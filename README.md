### Solution Workflow

1. End user submits an order through a web app which hosted in Azure web role.
2. The Azure web role publishes a message into Azure Service Bus Topic for the subscribers of the system in a distributed computing environment.
3. A worker processor  running in a Azure worker role subscribes the message from Azure Service Bus Topic , then process the order and finally persist the data into a NoSQL Database â€“ Azure DocumentDB.
4. A notification hub hosted in Azure worker role subscribes the message from Azure Service Bus Topic, then send cross platform, real-time push notifications to mobile apps running in Android, iOS and Windows Phone.
5. The web app hosted in Azure web role shows the status of orders which is processed in worker processor.
